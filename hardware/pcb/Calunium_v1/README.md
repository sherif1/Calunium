# Calunium v1

Proven design. Requires v1.0 Arduino IDE to support the reversed
analogue pin mapping. 


## Known errors

The only known errors are very minor issues with the silkscreen printing:
* "JP5" should be "JP5 (D7)" to indicate it affects D7.
* The value for IC1 should be MCP1702, not LM1702.
